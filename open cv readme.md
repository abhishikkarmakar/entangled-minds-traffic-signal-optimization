## Introduction
This project implements an intelligent traffic signal optimization algorithm that uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle counts captured from video footage. The objective is to minimize vehicle wait times and improve traffic flow efficiency.

## Project Overview
The algorithm detects vehicles in video feeds using OpenCV and calculates the optimal signal timings based on the number of vehicles detected in each lane. It employs reinforcement learning to adaptively modify detection parameters, allowing for real-time adjustments to the traffic signal based on current traffic conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Random
- Collections (deque)

## Algorithm
1. **Vehicle Detection**: Utilize OpenCV to process video feeds and detect vehicles. The detection results are used to count vehicles in each lane.
2. **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**: Implement a DQN agent to learn optimal actions for adjusting detection parameters based on vehicle counts.
3. **Signal Timing Calculation**: Calculate the optimal signal timing for each lane based on the detected vehicle counts and use this information to determine signal colors.
4. **Real-time Adjustments**: Use the DQN agent to adjust the vehicle detection thresholds dynamically to improve detection accuracy and optimize traffic signal timings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-traffic-signal-optimization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd intelligent-traffic-signal-optimization
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Make sure you have video files (`video_01.mp4`, `video_02.mp4`, etc.) available in the project directory for processing.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python traffic_signal_optimization.py
   ```
3. The program will process each video, display the vehicle detection results, and print the final vehicle counts and optimal timings for each lane.

### Notes
- Ensure that the appropriate video files are present in the directory before running the script.
- You may want to include sample video files or instructions on how to create them if they are not included in the repository.
